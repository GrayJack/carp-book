# The Carp Programming Language
by _Eric Shimizu Karbstein_

This book is a working in progress, I will try to keep up-to-date with the
language.

This version of the text assumes you're using the [master branch](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp) of the language (In the future it will change to version 0.4).
